# Redwood and AI

**Redwood** is the name of *Oracle's Next-Generation User Experience*. 

Redwood Design System is a collection of prefabricated components, templates, and patterns to enable developers to quickly create very sophisticated and polished interactions that are upgrades safe.

In a nutshell, this means that developers can extend their applications using the same development platform that Oracle Cloud applications are built on. 

## Oracle Visual Builder Studio

**Oracle Visual Builder Studio** is a robust application development platform that enables users to rapidly create and extend web, mobile, and progressive web interfaces using a visual development environment.

Visual Builder Studio Express Mode has two key components:
- Business Rules
- Constants 

## AI Agents

AI agents are a combination of LLMs and other advanced technologies that interact with their environments, automate complex tasks, and collaborate with employees in real time. 

Reasoning capabilities in these LLMS differentiate AI agents from the brittle rules-based automation of the past. Since they can make judgment calls, AI agents can create action plans and manage workflows, either independently or with human supervision.

**Oracle Fusion AI Agents** are autonomous assistants designed to help organizations streamline operations, improve decision making, and reduce manual workloads. They can assist with simple or complex tasks and work across departments. 

Oracle fusion AI agents represent a leap beyond traditional AI. They don't just automate, they collaborate with human workers, making AI agents more than just tools.
